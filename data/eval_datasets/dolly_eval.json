Kerfoot has been the majority owner of the Whitecaps since 2002, when he saved the club from contraction after previous owner David Stadnyk left the club, selling it to United Soccer Leagues. Mallett, a former chief operating officer (COO) of Yahoo!, who was raised in Victoria, British Columbia, and played for several collegiate soccer teams. He later purchased minority stakes in the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball and English soccer club Derby County F.C. Having first met at a charity soccer event in 2005, Mallett partnered with Steve Nash\u2014a two-time National Basketball Association (NBA) Most Valuable Player who was also raised in Victoria\u2014to put together a bid for a minority share of English soccer club Tottenham Hotspur F.C. in 2008. After that transaction fell through, the duo contacted Kerfoot about a minority stake in the club. Nash is the older brother of former Whitecaps midfielder Martin Nash. The fourth partner, Steve Luczo, is the president, chairman, and CEO of Seagate Technology and a partner in Boston Basketball Partners L.L.C., a group who own the NBA Boston Celtics. Luczo met Kerfoot while the two were both employed by Seagate Technology, and Kerfoot contacted Luczo proposing he become part of the club's MLS bid. In 2009, the group paid a $35 million expansion fee to MLS for the right to join the league.",

        "context": "The new operating system was initially without organizational backing, and also without a name. At this stage, the new operating system was a singletasking operating system, not a multitasking one such as Multics. The name Unics (Uniplexed Information and Computing Service, pronounced as \"eunuchs\"), a pun on Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computer Services), was initially suggested for the project in 1970. Brian Kernighan claims the coining for himself, and adds that \"no one can remember\" who came up with the final spelling Unix. Dennis Ritchie and Doug McIlroy also credit Kernighan.\n\nWhen the Computing Sciences Research Center wanted to use Unix on a machine larger than the PDP-7, while another department needed a word processor, Thompson and Ritchie added text processing capabilities to Unix and received funding for a PDP-11. For the first time in 1970, the Unix operating system was officially named and ran on the PDP-11. A text-formatting program called roff and a text editor were added. All three were written in PDP-11 assembly language. Bell Labs used this initial text-processing system, consisting of Unix, roff, and the editor, for text processing of patent applications. Roff soon evolved into troff, the first electronic publishing program with full typesetting capability.\n\nAs the system grew in complexity and the research team wanted more users, the need for a manual grew apparent. The UNIX Programmer's Manual was published on 3 November 1971; commands were documented in the \"man page\" format that is still used, offering terse reference information about usage as well as bugs in the software, and listing the authors of programs to channel questions to them.\n\nAfter other Bell Labs departments purchased DEC PDP-11s, they also chose to run Unix instead of DEC's own operating system. By Version 4 it was widely used within the laboratory and a Unix Support Group was formed, helping the operating system survive by formalizing its distribution.\n\nIn 1973, Version 4 Unix was rewritten in the higher-level language C, contrary to the general notion at the time that an operating system's complexity and sophistication required it to be written in assembly language. The C language appeared as part of Version 2. Thompson and Ritchie were so influential on early Unix that McIlroy estimated that they wrote and debugged about 100,000 lines of code that year, stating that \"[their names] may safely be assumed to be attached to almost everything not otherwise attributed\". Although assembly did not disappear from the man pages until Version 8, the migration to C suggested portability of the software, requiring only a relatively small amount of machine-dependent code to be replaced when porting Unix to other computing platforms. Version 4 Unix, however, still had considerable PDP-11-dependent code and was not suitable for porting. The first port to other platform was made five years later (1978) for Interdata 8/32.\n\nThe Unix operating system was first presented formally to the outside world at the 1973 Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, where Ritchie and Thompson delivered a paper. This led to requests for the system, but under a 1956 consent decree in settlement of an antitrust case, the Bell System (the parent organization of Bell Labs) was forbidden from entering any business other than \"common carrier communications services\", and was required to license any patents it had upon request. Unix could not, therefore, be turned into a product. Bell Labs instead shipped the system for the cost of media and shipping. Ken Thompson quietly began answering requests by shipping out tapes and disks, each accompanied by \u2013 according to legend \u2013 a note signed, \"Love, Ken\".",

People who vote for gun laws have not had someone in their family shot or impacted. We don't want a personal event or death of a closed one to create a new law. An eye for an eye doesn't bring lives back. Educate the masses. Also, women tend to vote more positive on banning rifles as compared to men. Get more women out to change the law.\n\n2.  There is license for fishing and hunting. Guns should be rented and not owned. If you're into recreational things make it possible to rent guns and not own.  Do background check, and let the person enjoy his time with the toys but cannot own it. This would allow the manufacture and NRA in business. \n\n3. Never sell assault rifles to general public. A person who needs to have assault rifles are insecure by nature. They fear that the public is trying to get at them and they need to protect.

While hailing from Italy, or so they say, pizza is enjoyed across the globe. Second, it's very accessible, on a couple of fronts. If you want just a snack, you can have just one slice of pizza. If you need to feed a family, you can order a whole pizza pie. If you need to feed a large group - pizza can be ordered and received in large quantities. Then, there are the varieties of pizza. There are many different types of crust to suit your preferences. There are many different types of sauces, cheeses, and toppings that can put on pizza. Nearly an limitless combination of pizzas to suit all palettes. But the best reason is simply the depth of flavor in each and every bite. There is a delicious amount of complexity in every bite: a crunch, warm, maybe a little spice, a little sweet from the tomato sauce and of course added complexities from whichever toppings you choose.

It is the oldest organized sport in North America,[ with its origins with the indigenous people of North America as early as the 12th century.The game was extensively modified by European colonists, reducing the violence, to create its current collegiate and professional form.\n\nPlayers use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry, pass, catch, and shoot the ball into the goal. The sport has four versions that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment: field lacrosse, women's lacrosse, box lacrosse and intercrosse. The men's games, field lacrosse (outdoor) and box lacrosse (indoor), are contact sports and all players wear protective gear: helmet, gloves, shoulder pads, and elbow pads. The women's game is played outdoors and does not allow body contact but does allow stick to stick contact.The only protective gear required for women players is eyegear, while goalies wear helmets and protective pads. Both men's and women's field lacrosse have 6v6 versions played on smaller fields, gaining acceptance in multi-sport events. Intercrosse is a mixed-gender non-contact sport played indoors that uses an all-plastic stick and a softer ball.\n\nThe modern sport is governed by World Lacrosse and is the only international sport organization to recognize First Nations bands and Native American tribes as sovereign nations.The organization hosts the World Lacrosse Championship for men, the Women's Lacrosse World Cup, the World Indoor Lacrosse Championship for box lacrosse, and the Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships for both men and women. Each is held every four years. Lacrosse at the Summer Olympics has been contested at two editions of the Summer Olympic Games, 1904 and 1908.It was also held as a demonstration event at the 1928, 1932, and 1948 Summer Olympics.",

        "context": "Authoritarianism is a political system characterized by the rejection of political plurality, the use of strong central power to preserve the political status quo, and reductions in the rule of law, separation of powers, and democratic voting. Political scientists have created many typologies describing variations of authoritarian forms of government. Authoritarian regimes may be either autocratic or oligarchic and may be based upon the rule of a party or the military. States that have a blurred boundary between democracy and authoritarianism have some times been characterized as \"hybrid democracies\", \"hybrid regimes\" or \"competitive authoritarian\" states.\n\nThe political scientist Juan Linz, in an influential 1964 work, An Authoritarian Regime: Spain, defined authoritarianism as possessing four qualities:\n\nLimited political pluralism, is realized with constraints on the legislature, political parties and interest groups.\nPolitical legitimacy is based upon appeals to emotion and identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat \"easily recognizable societal problems, such as underdevelopment or insurgency.\"\nMinimal political mobilization, and suppression of anti-regime activities.\nIll-defined executive powers, often vague and shifting extend the power of the executive.\nMinimally defined, an authoritarian government lacks free and competitive direct elections to legislatures, free and competitive direct or indirect elections for executives, or both. Broadly defined, authoritarian states include countries that lack civil liberties such as freedom of religion, or countries in which the government and the opposition do not alternate in power at least once following free elections. Authoritarian states might contain nominally democratic institutions such as political parties, legislatures and elections which are managed to entrench authoritarian rule and can feature fraudulent, non-competitive elections. In contexts of democratic backsliding, scholars tend to identify authoritarian political leaders based on certain tactics, such as: politicizing independent institutions, spreading disinformation, aggrandizing executive power, quashing dissent, targeting vulnerable communities, stoking violence, and corrupting elections. Since 1946, the share of authoritarian states in the international political system increased until the mid-1970s but declined from then until the year 2000.",

Second step is to carefully measure the open space after you've cut the square.  Take your time and measure as close to the existing drywall as possible.  Take 4 measurements of 2 in length and 2 in width to ensure accuracy.  Cut that square from your replacement drywall.  Shave sides with sandpaper for tight fit.  Once your replacement square fits, insert drywall screws into the sides of the drywall that will also go through the previously exposed wooden studs.  Once the new square is secure, you can layer ontop the drywall paste to let dry.  Sand the drywall paste over the seams of the square, and repeat as necessary until you have a uniform, smooth surface.  Apply paint over the entire workspace and let dry.",

These mechanisms of secretion and reabsorption balance the pH of the bloodstream. A restored acid-base balanced bloodstream thus leads to a restored acid-base balance throughout the entire body.",

The faster the airplane flies, the more lift is generated. In helicopters on the other hand, lift is generated by the spinning rotor blades. If the helicopter is in motion, the blades will produce more lift on the side where they are moving in the helicopter's direction of travel (advancing), than on the side where they are moving in the opposite direction (retreating). This is called dissymetry of lift. The faster the helicopter flies, the bigger this dissymetry will get.

        "context": "",
        "response": "First, let's establish the meaning of a split infinitive. In simple terms the infinitive is the grammatical construct in which a verb is preceded by the word 'to': hence, 'to walk', 'to talk', 'to reason'. As a side-note, it's probably worth exploring whether the 'verbification' of nouns is a good thing: personally, I take issue with this and feel that examples such as 'to medal', meaning 'to win a medal at a sporting event', should never have been visited on the English language. But that's another discussion entirely. Returning to the infinitive, the split occurs when another word (usually an adverb) is placed between the word 'to' and its corresponding verb. Probably the most famous split infinitive occurs in the opening sequence of every episode of the classic and original TV show, Star Trek, with the lines:\n\"Space: The final frontier\nThese are the voyages of the Starship, Enterprise;\nIts five year mission:\nto explore strange new worlds;\nto seek out new life and new civilizations;\nto boldly go where no man has gone before.\"\nNote that final line: 'to boldly go'. Never has an infinitive been split so boldly before or since. Those who are grammatical pedants will have shuddered at this every time (and probably ended up preferring Star Wars to Star Trek as a consequence) but through those original seventy-nine episodes and their many repeat showings, the split infinitive has subtly embedded itself in our lexicon. \nSo, to return to the question, is it wrong to split the infinitive? Since language is constantly evolving, influenced by the whims and practices of each generation, the answer must be 'no'. On the whole sentences tend to flow more freely and with greater elan if infinitives aren't split and pesky adverbs are kept in their place either before or after ('to go boldly' or 'boldly to go') but sometimes one has to admit that splitting works, and we should be thankful for the colour that brings to the language we hear daily. Who nowadays wouldn't want to boldly go?",

It was established by the 42nd U.S. Congress with the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872. Yellowstone was the first national park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the first national park in the world. The park is known for its wildlife and its many geothermal features, especially the Old Faithful geyser, one of its most popular. While it represents many types of biomes, the subalpine forest is the most abundant. It is part of the South Central Rockies forests ecoregion.\n\nWhile Native Americans have lived in the Yellowstone region for at least 11,000 years, aside from visits by mountain men during the early-to-mid-19th century, organized exploration did not begin until the late 1860s. Management and control of the park originally fell under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the first Secretary of the Interior to supervise the park being Columbus Delano. However, the U.S. Army was eventually commissioned to oversee the management of Yellowstone for 30 years between 1886 and 1916. In 1917, administration of the park was transferred to the National Park Service, which had been created the previous year. Hundreds of structures have been built and are protected for their architectural and historical significance, and researchers have examined more than a thousand archaeological sites.\n\nYellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,468.4 sq mi (8,983 km2), comprising lakes, canyons, rivers, and mountain ranges. Yellowstone Lake is one of the largest high-elevation lakes in North America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest super volcano on the continent. The caldera is considered a dormant volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years. Well over half of the world's geysers and hydrothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. The park is the centerpiece of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystem in the Earth's northern temperate zone. In 1978, Yellowstone was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nHundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians have been documented, including several that are either endangered or threatened. The vast forests and grasslands also include unique species of plants. Yellowstone Park is the largest, and most famous megafauna location in the contiguous United States. Grizzly bears, cougars, wolves, and free-ranging herds of bison and elk live in this park. The Yellowstone Park bison herd is the oldest and largest public bison herd in the United States. Forest fires occur in the park each year; in the large forest fires of 1988, nearly one-third of the park was burnt. Yellowstone has numerous recreational opportunities, including hiking, camping, boating, fishing, and sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During the winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours that use either snow coaches or snowmobiles.",
        "response": "Generally considered to be the first national park in the world, Yellowstone National Park is significant in size, covering parts of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, and acts as the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystems.  The park is able to support many types of wildlife including Grizzly bears, cougars, wolves, mountain goats, free-ranging herds of bison and elk, as well as many types of birds and fish, because of the diversity of habitats.  Forests and grasslands dominate some areas of the park, while others offer the completely different experience of mountain ranges, lakes, and rolling prairies.  Some of the park's most unique features are the geysers and hydrothermal features.  In fact, Yellowstone is home to over half of the world's features like these.  This is due to the entire park being centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest super volcano on the continent.",

Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine.

The bulk of production was from the dominant Staffordshire pottery industry. America was a major market for English transfer-printed wares, whose imagery was adapted to the American market; several makers made this almost exclusively.\n\nThe technique was essential for adding complex decoration such as the Willow pattern to relatively cheap pottery. In particular, transfer printing brought the price of a matching dinner service low enough for large numbers of people to afford.\n\nApart from pottery, the technique was used on metal, and enamelled metal, and sometimes on wood and textiles. It remains used today, although mostly superseded by lithography. In the 19th century methods of transfer printing in colour were developed.",

This is illustrated in classical mechanics, where the motion of a body is described by its position and velocity as the time value varies. Newton's laws allow one (given the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body) to express these variables dynamically as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time.

First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; modern C++ currently has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.\n\nC++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).\n\nC++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization. Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release schedule with C++23 as the next planned standard.",

Keyboardist Boom Gaspar has also been a touring/session member with the band since 2002. Drummers Jack Irons, Dave Krusen, Matt Chamberlain, and Dave Abbruzzese are former members of the band. Pearl Jam outsold many of their contemporaries from the early 1990s, and are considered one of the most influential bands of the decade, being dubbed as \"the most popular American rock and roll band of the '90s\".\n\nFormed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with their debut album, Ten, in 1991. Ten stayed on the Billboard 200 chart for nearly five years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock records ever, going 13\u00d7 platinum in the United States. Released in 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold over 950,000 copies in its first week of release, setting the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release at the time. Their third album, Vitalogy (1994), became the second-fastest-selling CD in history at the time, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week.\n\nOne of the key bands in the grunge movement of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam's members often shunned popular music industry practices such as making music videos or participating in interviews. The band also sued Ticketmaster, claiming it had monopolized the concert-ticket market. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having \"spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.\"\n\nPearl Jam had sold more than 85 million albums worldwide by 2018, including nearly 32 million albums in the United States by 2012, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Pearl Jam was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017 in its first year of eligibility. They were ranked eighth in a readers' poll by Rolling Stone magazine in its \"Top Ten Live Acts of All Time\" issue. Throughout its career, the band has also promoted wider social and political issues, from pro-abortion rights sentiments to opposition to George W. Bush's presidency.

        "response": "Okay the first obvious point to make here is that the thing that will make any piece of art - including a wood carving - look more professional is the quality of the art!  That means the skill and the artistic quality that goes into it, specifically.  But there are a couple things you can do to dress it up a bit - think about your school days and sliding that english paper into a fresh new folder with a carefully penned title on the front. So back to wood carving.  What can you do?  Let's say you've carved yourself a nice salmon complete with fens and gill lines.  Well here are three ways to dress it up.  First and most obvious  - paint it.  You can go for detail paint or you can use more of a water color approach that will give the wood a colored wash.  The sky is really the limit here.  Second, you mount it on a stand so it floats about the ground.  Drill a small whole in the bottom of the fish, do the same in a wood block you've sanded up and you have s stand.  Third and a bit more out there - consider if there are simple additions you can add.  I made an angler fish and used a drive flower with stem as the attached antenna.  Look around and think about what you can add to your project.  Last and most basic, put a coat of varnish on it to seal it up - and if you choose give it a bit of shine.  All these ideas will give a little bit of extra finish and pop to your project.",

When the car pulled behind the grandstands, one teenager fired on a crowd of 300 people with a shotgun, causing seven people to receive injuries. Six of the injured were teenagers, ranged in age from 13 to 19. One received critical injuries. All six received treatment at the Detroit Receiving Hospital. The shootings occurred at 4:15 PM, and the suspects left the scene. This shooting was the week's second shooting that had high school students involved. The shooting was the second one in a month in which Homecoming activities were involved. Police said that one of the suspects had been involved in a fight on an earlier occasion.\n\nOn April 16, 1987, a student at Murray\u2013Wright entered the school parking lot and shot 17-year-old Chester Jackson, a junior running back, in the head, killing him. The attacker went into the gymnasium and shot 18-year-old Damon Matthews, a basketball player, in the face. Tomeka Turner, an 18-year-old, was wounded. Risen said that Turner's injuries occurred \"apparently in the school's corridors as the attacker fled the building.\" The youth with facial injuries received treatment at the Detroit Receiving Hospital. The incident occurred around noon. The attacker, Michael Schofield, was 14 at the time of the crime. Schofield, 15 years old at sentencing, was sentenced to serve in a juvenile correctional facility until he turned 19. Schofield killed four people in 2003 during an attempted robbery of a convenience store in Westland, Michigan, and then killed himself. The Los Angeles Times News Service said that the 1987 Murray\u2013Wright shooting was the incident that put \"most clearly into focus\" the epidemic of youth violence in Detroit.\n\nAfter the murder and shootings, school officials started a plan to reduce violence in the school.

        "context": "Sorted arrays with binary search are a very inefficient solution when insertion and deletion operations are interleaved with retrieval, taking \n\nO(n) time for each such operation. In addition, sorted arrays can complicate memory use especially when elements are often inserted into the array. There are other data structures that support much more efficient insertion and deletion. Binary search can be used to perform exact matching and set membership (determining whether a target value is in a collection of values). There are data structures that support faster exact matching and set membership. However, unlike many other searching schemes, binary search can be used for efficient approximate matching, usually performing such matches in \nO(log n) time regardless of the type or structure of the values themselves. In addition, there are some operations, like finding the smallest and largest element, that can be performed efficiently on a sorted array.\n\nLinear search:\n\nLinear search is a simple search algorithm that checks every record until it finds the target value. Linear search can be done on a linked list, which allows for faster insertion and deletion than an array. Binary search is faster than linear search for sorted arrays except if the array is short, although the array needs to be sorted beforehand. All sorting algorithms based on comparing elements, such as quicksort and merge sort, require at least \nO(nlog n) comparisons in the worst case. Unlike linear search, binary search can be used for efficient approximate matching. There are operations such as finding the smallest and largest element that can be done efficiently on a sorted array but not on an unsorted array.\n\nTrees:\n\nBinary search trees are searched using an algorithm similar to binary search.\nA binary search tree is a binary tree data structure that works based on the principle of binary search. The records of the tree are arranged in sorted order, and each record in the tree can be searched using an algorithm similar to binary search, taking on average logarithmic time. Insertion and deletion also require on average logarithmic time in binary search trees. This can be faster than the linear time insertion and deletion of sorted arrays, and binary trees retain the ability to perform all the operations possible on a sorted array, including range and approximate queries.\n\nHowever, binary search is usually more efficient for searching as binary search trees will most likely be imperfectly balanced, resulting in slightly worse performance than binary search. This even applies to balanced binary search trees, binary search trees that balance their own nodes, because they rarely produce the tree with the fewest possible levels. Except for balanced binary search trees, the tree may be severely imbalanced with few internal nodes with two children, resulting in the average and worst-case search time approaching \nn comparisons. Binary search trees take more space than sorted arrays.\n\nBinary search trees lend themselves to fast searching in external memory stored in hard disks, as binary search trees can be efficiently structured in filesystems. The B-tree generalizes this method of tree organization. B-trees are frequently used to organize long-term storage such as databases and filesystems.\n\nHashing:\nFor implementing associative arrays, hash tables, a data structure that maps keys to records using a hash function, are generally faster than binary search on a sorted array of records.Most hash table implementations require only amortized constant time on average.However, hashing is not useful for approximate matches, such as computing the next-smallest, next-largest, and nearest key, as the only information given on a failed search is that the target is not present in any record. Binary search is ideal for such matches, performing them in logarithmic time. Binary search also supports approximate matches. Some operations, like finding the smallest and largest element, can be done efficiently on sorted arrays but not on hash tables.\n\nSet membership algorithms:\nA related problem to search is set membership. Any algorithm that does lookup, like binary search, can also be used for set membership. There are other algorithms that are more specifically suited for set membership. A bit array is the simplest, useful when the range of keys is limited. It compactly stores a collection of bits, with each bit representing a single key within the range of keys. Bit arrays are very fast, requiring only \nO(1) time.The Judy1 type of Judy array handles 64-bit keys efficiently.\n\nFor approximate results, Bloom filters, another probabilistic data structure based on hashing, store a set of keys by encoding the keys using a bit array and multiple hash functions. Bloom filters are much more space-efficient than bit arrays in most cases and not much slower: with \nk hash functions, membership queries require only \n O(k) time. However, Bloom filters suffer from false positives.\n\nOther data structures:\nThere exist data structures that may improve on binary search in some cases for both searching and other operations available for sorted arrays. For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data structures such as van Emde Boas trees, fusion trees, tries, and bit arrays. These specialized data structures are usually only faster because they take advantage of the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute. As long as the keys can be ordered, these operations can always be done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys. Some structures, such as Judy arrays, use a combination of approaches to mitigate this while retaining efficiency and the ability to perform approximate matching.",

        "context": "Although the Sun appears to \"rise\" from the horizon, it is actually the Earth's motion that causes the Sun to appear. The illusion of a moving Sun results from Earth observers being in a rotating reference frame; this apparent motion caused many cultures to have mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model, which prevailed until astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus formulated his heliocentric model in the 16th century.\nAstronomically, sunrise occurs for only an instant: the moment at which the upper limb of the Sun appears tangent to the horizon. However, the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point:\nTwilight, the period in the morning during which the sky is brightening, but the Sun is not yet visible. The beginning of morning twilight is called astronomical dawn.\nThe period after the Sun rises during which striking colors and atmospheric effects are still seen.\nThe timing of sunrise varies throughout the year and is also affected by the viewer's latitude and longitude, altitude, and time zone. These changes are driven by the axial tilt of Earth, daily rotation of the Earth, the planet's movement in its annual elliptical orbit around the Sun, and the Earth and Moon's paired revolutions around each other. The analemma can be used to make approximate predictions of the time of sunrise.\nIn late winter and spring, sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day, reaching its earliest time near the summer solstice; although the exact date varies by latitude. After this point, the time of sunrise gets later each day, reaching its latest sometime around the winter solstice. The offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of Earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis, and is described by the analemma, which can be used to predict the dates.\nVariations in atmospheric refraction can alter the time of sunrise by changing its apparent position. Near the poles, the time-of-day variation is exaggerated, since the Sun crosses the horizon at a very shallow angle and thus rises more slowly.\nAccounting for atmospheric refraction and measuring from the leading edge slightly increases the average duration of day relative to night. The sunrise equation, however, which is used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset, uses the Sun's physical center for calculation, neglecting atmospheric refraction and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc.",
        "response": "Astronomically, sunrise occurs for only an instant: the moment at which the upper limb of the Sun appears tangent to the horizon. However, the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point. Twilight, the period in the morning during which the sky is brightening, but the Sun is not yet visible. The beginning of morning twilight is called astronomical dawn. The period after the Sun rises during which striking colors and atmospheric effects are still seen.",

He was the youngest person to assume the presidency by election and the youngest president at the end of his tenure.

He was the youngest person to assume the presidency by election and the youngest president at the end of his tenure. Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War, and the majority of his foreign policy concerned relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba. A Democrat, Kennedy represented Massachusetts in both houses of the U.S. Congress prior to his presidency.\n\nBorn into the prominent Kennedy family in Brookline, Massachusetts, Kennedy graduated from Harvard University in 1940 before joining the U.S. Naval Reserve the following year. During World War II, he commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater. Kennedy's survival following the sinking of PT-109 and his rescue of his fellow sailors made him a war hero and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, but left him with serious injuries. After a brief stint in journalism, Kennedy represented a working-class Boston district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953. He was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate and served as the junior senator for Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960. While in the Senate, Kennedy published his book, Profiles in Courage, which won a Pulitzer Prize. Kennedy ran in the 1960 presidential election. His campaign gained momentum after the first televised presidential debates in American history, and he was elected president, narrowly defeating Republican opponent Richard Nixon, who was the incumbent vice president. He was the first Catholic elected president.\n\nKennedy's administration included high tensions with communist states in the Cold War. He increased the number of American military advisors in South Vietnam. He authorized numerous operations to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro, including the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961. The following October, U.S. spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases in Cuba; the resulting period of tensions, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. He also signed the first nuclear weapons treaty in October 1963. Kennedy presided over the establishment of the Peace Corps, Alliance for Progress with Latin America, and the continuation of the Apollo program with the goal of landing a man on the Moon. He also supported the civil rights movement but was only somewhat successful in passing his New Frontier domestic policies.\n\nOn November 22, 1963, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. His vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, assumed the presidency upon Kennedy's death. Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, was arrested for the assassination, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later. The FBI and the Warren Commission both concluded Oswald had acted alone, but conspiracy theories about the assassination still persist. After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Revenue Act of 1964. Kennedy ranks highly in polls of U.S. presidents with historians and the general public. His personal life has also been the focus of considerable sustained interest following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and extramarital affairs. Kennedy is the most recent U.S. president to have died in office.",

Its total height is 165 m (541 feet), making it the tallest man-made waterfall in the world.\n\nIt is located 7.7 km from Terni, a provincial capital of the Italian region of Umbria. \n\nIts source is a portion of the waters of the river Velino. After flowing through Piediluco lake near the community of Marmore (italian), it pours into the valley below formed by the river Nera. The flow of the waterfall depends on an off and on scale with a published schedule to support the power company nearby.\n\nMost of the time, the water in the canals above the Cascata delle Marmore falls is diverted to a hydroelectric power plant, so the flow in the falls themselves is heavily reduced. Piediluco Lake, above the falls, is used as a reservoir for the power plant. The Galleto power plant, built in 1929, is architecturally interesting. Its capacity is about 530 MW. To control the operation of the power plant, and to satisfy tourists, the falls are turned on according to a set schedule, achieving a spectacular effect at full flow. An alarm is sounded first, then the gates are opened, and in a few minutes the small stream is transformed into a full-sized river rushing into the void below.\n\nNormally, the falls are turned on between 12:00 and 13:00 and again between 16:00 and 17:00 every day, with additional times on holidays. An entrance fee is charged to visit the falls and the surrounding area.\n\nA path along the falls allows the visitor to hike up to the top of the falls.

Nicknamed \"King James\", he is considered to be one of the greatest basketball players in history and is often compared to Michael Jordan in debates over the greatest basketball player of all time. James is the all-time leading scorer in NBA history and ranks fourth in career assists. He has won four NBA championships (two with the Miami Heat, one each with the Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers), and has competed in 10 NBA Finals. He has four MVP awards, four Finals MVP awards, and two Olympic gold medals. He has been named an All-Star 19 times, selected to the All-NBA Team 18 times (including 13 First Team selections) and the All-Defensive Team six times, and was a runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice in his career.\n\nJames grew up playing basketball for St. Vincent\u2013St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar. A prep-to-pro, he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year, he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010. After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat; this was announced in a nationally televised special titled The Decision and is among the most controversial free agency moves in sports history.\n\nJames won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he also earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract and re-signed with the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3\u20131 deficit, delivering the team's first championship and ending the Cleveland sports curse. In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 NBA championship and his fourth Finals MVP. James is the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player. On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the all-time leading scorer in NBA history.\n\nOff the court, James has accumulated more wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning two Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He has won 19 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). James has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron.",

When you sum up Lebron's career totals, they are equaling mind-blowing, as the NBA's all-time leading scorer, he is also 4th in career assists. Lebron's greatest achievement on the court is commonly viewed as the time he led the Cleveland Cavaliers back to championship glory, coming back from a 3-1 deficit to the Golden State Warriors in 2016.",
