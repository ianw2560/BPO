        "original_response": "To analyze the tone of an email based on word choice, phrasing, punctuation, and capitalization, it's important to consider how these elements contribute to the overall impression the writer conveys. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how each element can influence tone:\n\n1. **Word Choice**: The specific words used can convey a range of emotions. For example, words like \"unfortunately\" or \"disappointed\" can suggest a disheartening or regretful tone, while words like \"great\" or \"excited\" can convey joy or optimism.\n\n2. **Phrasing**: The structure of sentences can also impact tone. Short, direct sentences may come across as assertive or confident, while longer, more complex sentences might seem formal or unassuming.\n\n3. **Punctuation**: The use of punctuation marks like exclamation points can indicate excitement or surprise, while ellipses might suggest hesitation or worry. Overuse of punctuation can sometimes seem informal or overly emotional.\n\n4. **Capitalization**: Capitalization can emphasize certain words, potentially making the tone seem more assertive or even accusatory if used excessively.\n\nWithout the specific content of the email, I can provide a general idea of how these elements might combine to create different tones:\n\n- **Disheartening/Regretful**: Use of words like \"unfortunately,\" \"regret,\" or \"sadly,\" with a formal phrasing and minimal punctuation.\n- **Accusatory**: Direct language with strong words, possibly capitalized for emphasis, and assertive phrasing.\n- **Worried/Concerned**: Phrasing that includes questions or expressions of uncertainty, with punctuation like ellipses or question marks.\n- **Curious**: Questions and open-ended phrasing, possibly with a mix of formal and informal language.\n- **Surprised/Excited**: Exclamation points and enthusiastic language, with informal phrasing.\n- **Disapproving**: Formal language with critical word choice, possibly with assertive punctuation.\n- **Unassuming/Formal**: Polite, neutral language with complex sentences and minimal emotional punctuation.\n- **Assertive/Confident**: Direct language with clear, strong word choice and punctuation that emphasizes certainty.\n- **Appreciative/Joyful**: Positive language with words like \"thank you\" or \"grateful,\" possibly with exclamation points.\n- **Optimistic/Encouraging**: Positive, forward-looking language with words like \"hope\" or \"looking forward,\" possibly with exclamation points.\n\nIf you provide the specific content of the email, I can offer a more precise analysis of the tone.",

Nearby, an artist sketched, capturing the vibrancy of the day with each stroke.\n\nAnna closed her eyes, breathing in the scent of blooming flowers. The world around her pulsed with energy, a tapestry of sounds and sights. She felt a sense of peace, a moment of stillness amid the chaos.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink, Anna rose from the bench.

Let's say you're interested in finding a code snippet for a common algorithm like \"binary search.\" Here's a brief explanation and a code snippet in Python:\n\n### Binary Search Algorithm\n\nBinary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the portion of the list that could contain the item in half until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Start with the middle element of the sorted array.\n2. If the target value is equal to the middle element, the search is complete.\n3. If the target value is less than the middle element, repeat the search on the left half of the array.\n4. If the target value is greater than the middle element, repeat the search on the right half of the array.\n5. Continue this process until the target value is found or the subarray size becomes zero.\n\n#### Python Code Snippet:\n\n```python\ndef binary_search(arr, target):\n    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    \n    while left <= right:\n        mid = left + (right - left) // 2\n        \n        # Check if target is present at mid\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        # If target is greater, ignore left half\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            left = mid + 1\n        # If target is smaller, ignore right half\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    \n    # Target is not present in array\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nsorted_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\ntarget_value = 5\nresult = binary_search(sorted_array, target_value)\n\nif result != -1:\n    print(f\"Element found at index {result}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Element not found in array\")\n```\n\nThis code defines a `binary_search` function that takes a sorted array and a target value as inputs and returns the index of the target value if it is present in the array, or `-1` if it is not. You can test it with different arrays and target values to see how it works. Let me know if you need further explanation or another algorithm!"

        "optimized_prompt": "Please provide guidance on how to effectively use randomized text within a Word document while maintaining coherence and readability. Include tips for selecting relevant and engaging filler content, and explain how to integrate it seamlessly into the document.",
        "original_response": "Using random text as filler content in a Word document can be useful for layout purposes or to visualize how a document will look with actual content. Microsoft Word provides built-in functions to generate random text. Here are the steps to do so:\n\n### Using the Built-in Functions\n\n1. **Open Your Word Document:**\n   - Start by opening the Word document where you want to insert the filler text.\n\n2. **Choose the Location:**\n   - Click on the location in the document where you want the filler text to appear.\n\n3. **Use the `=rand()` Function:**\n   - Type `=rand(p,s)` and press Enter.\n   - Replace `p` with the number of paragraphs you want.\n   - Replace `s` with the number of sentences per paragraph.\n   - For example, `=rand(3,5)` will generate 3 paragraphs with 5 sentences each.\n\n4. **Use the `=lorem()` Function:**\n   - Type `=lorem(p,s)` and press Enter.\n   - This function generates \"Lorem Ipsum\" text, which is a standard placeholder text.\n   - Replace `p` and `s` as described above.\n\n5. **Use the `=rand.old()` Function:**\n   - Type `=rand.old(p,s)` and press Enter.\n   - This generates the classic \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\" text.\n   - Again, replace `p` and `s` as needed.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Adjusting Text:**\n  - You can adjust the number of paragraphs and sentences to fit your needs by changing the numbers in the parentheses.\n\n- **Formatting:**\n  - Once the text is generated, you can format it like any other text in Word, changing fonts, sizes, colors, etc.\n\n- **Deleting Filler Text:**\n  - When you no longer need the filler text, simply select it and press the Delete key.\n\nThese methods are quick and efficient for generating placeholder text directly within Word without needing to copy and paste from external sources.",
        "optimized_response": "Using randomized text in a Word document can be a useful technique for various purposes, such as creating placeholders during the drafting process or testing layout designs. However, maintaining coherence and readability is crucial, especially if the document will be shared with others. Here are some tips to effectively use randomized text while ensuring the document remains engaging and coherent:\n\n### 1. Purpose and Context\n- **Define the Purpose**: Clearly understand why you are using randomized text. Is it for layout testing, brainstorming, or as a placeholder until final content is ready?\n- **Know Your Audience**: Consider who will be reading the document. If it\u2019s for internal use, you might have more flexibility with the content. For external audiences, ensure the text is professional and relevant.\n\n### 2. Selecting Filler Content\n- **Use Lorem Ipsum**: This is a classic choice for filler text. It\u2019s nonsensical in meaning but provides a natural distribution of letters and words, which helps in visualizing the final layout.\n- **Themed Content**: Choose filler text that aligns with the document\u2019s theme. For example, if you\u2019re drafting a document about technology, use tech-related jargon or concepts.\n- **Quotes and Anecdotes**: Incorporate relevant quotes or short anecdotes that relate to the document\u2019s subject. This can make the filler content more engaging.\n\n### 3. Maintaining Coherence\n- **Consistent Style**: Ensure that the style of the randomized text matches the rest of the document. This includes font, size, and formatting.\n- **Logical Flow**: Even if the text is random, try to maintain a logical flow. Use headings and subheadings to organize the content and guide the reader.\n- **Transitional Phrases**: Use transitional phrases to connect different sections of the text, making it easier for readers to follow.\n\n### 4. Integration Techniques\n- **Blend with Real Content**: Mix randomized text with real content to create a seamless transition. For example, start with a real introduction, use filler text in the body, and conclude with a real summary.\n- **Visual Elements**: Incorporate images, charts, or tables alongside the filler text to break up the monotony and add visual interest.\n- **Annotations and Comments**: Use Word\u2019s comment feature to annotate sections of randomized text, explaining their purpose or what the final content will entail.\n\n### 5. Review and Edit\n- **Proofread**: Even though the text is randomized, ensure there are no glaring errors that could distract or confuse readers.\n- **Feedback**: If possible, get feedback from colleagues or peers to ensure the document is coherent and serves its intended purpose.\n\n### 6. Transition to Final Content\n- **Gradual Replacement**: As you develop the final content, gradually replace the filler text. This helps maintain the document\u2019s structure and flow.\n- **Version Control**: Keep track of different versions of the document to ensure you don\u2019t lose any important changes during the transition.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can effectively use randomized text in a Word document while maintaining coherence and readability, ensuring that the document remains useful and engaging throughout its development process."

It summarizes the key points of the document.\n\n% End the document\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`\\documentclass{article}`**: This command specifies the type of document you are creating. In this case, it's an article.\n- **`\\begin{document}` and `\\end{document}`**: These commands mark the beginning and end of the document content.\n- **`\\title{...}`, `\\author{...}`, and `\\date{...}`**: These commands define the title, author, and date of the document, respectively.\n- **`\\maketitle`**: This command generates the title section of the document.\n- **`\\tableofcontents`**: This command generates the table of contents. It will automatically include all sections, subsections, etc., that are defined in the document.\n- **`\\section{...}` and `\\subsection{...}`**: These commands define sections and subsections within the document. They are automatically included in the table of contents.\n\nWhen you compile this LaTeX document, the table of contents will be generated based on the sections and subsections you have defined. Note that you may need to compile the document twice for the table of contents to appear correctly, as LaTeX needs to gather information about the sections during the first compilation.",
        "optimized_response": "In LaTeX, you can automatically generate a table of contents using the `\\tableofcontents` command. This command is typically used in conjunction with the `\\section`, `\\subsection`, and `\\subsubsection` commands to create entries in the table of contents.

It summarizes the document.\n\n% End the document\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Document Class**: We use the `article` class, but you can use other classes like `report` or `book` depending on your needs.\n\n2. **Title and Author**: The `\\title`, `\\author`, and `\\date` commands are used to specify the title, author, and date of the document. The `\\maketitle` command then generates the title section.\n\n3. **Table of Contents**: The `\\tableofcontents` command is placed where you want the table of contents to appear in the document. It will automatically list all sections, subsections, and subsubsections.\n\n4. **Sections**: The `\\section`, `\\subsection`, and `\\subsubsection` commands are used to create sections and subsections in the document. These will automatically be included in the table of contents.\n\n5. **Compilation**: To ensure the table of contents is generated correctly, you may need to compile your LaTeX document twice. The first compilation writes the section information to the `.toc` file, and the second compilation reads this file to generate the table of contents.\n\nThis setup will automatically generate and update the table of contents as you add or modify sections in your document."

Below is a step-by-step guide and a sample LaTeX code to achieve this.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n1. **Install the `chessboard` package**: Ensure that your LaTeX distribution includes the `chessboard` package. Most modern distributions like TeX Live or MiKTeX should have it.\n\n2. **Understand the FEN string**: A FEN string describes a particular board position. It consists of six fields, but for drawing the board, the first field (piece placement) is the most important.\n\n3. **Use the `\\fenboard` command**: The `chessboard` package provides the `\\fenboard` command to set up the board according to the FEN string.\n\n4. **Draw the board**: Use the `\\showboard` command to display the board.\n\n### Sample LaTeX Code\n\nHere is a complete LaTeX document that uses the `chessboard` package to display a chessboard from a given FEN string:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{chessboard}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n% Example FEN: Starting position\n% rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1\n\n% Set the FEN string\n\\fenboard{rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR}\n\n% Display the board\n\\showboard\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Document Class**: We use the `article` class, which is sufficient for this purpose.\n- **Package**: The `chessboard` package is included to handle chessboard rendering.\n- **FEN String**: The `\\fenboard` command is used to set the board state. Replace the FEN string with your desired position.\n- **Display**: The `\\showboard` command renders the board on the document.\n\n### Customization\n\n- **Board Size**: You can adjust the size of the board using options in the `\\chessboard` command, such as `\\chessboard[scale=1.5]`.\n- **Coordinates**: To display coordinates, use `\\chessboard[showmover=false, label=true]`.\n\nThis setup will allow you to visualize any chess position given its FEN string in a LaTeX document.",

        "original_response": "Uploading a bibliography database to Overleaf is a straightforward process. Here\u2019s a simple guide to help you get started:\n\n### Step 1: Prepare Your Bibliography File\n1. **Create a `.bib` File**: Ensure your bibliography is in a BibTeX format, typically with a `.bib` extension. You can create this file using a text editor or export it from reference management software like Zotero, Mendeley, or EndNote.\n\n2. **Check the Format**: Make sure your `.bib` file is correctly formatted. Each entry should follow the BibTeX structure, for example:\n   ```bibtex\n   @article{key,\n     author = {Author Name},\n     title = {Title of the Paper},\n     journal = {Journal Name},\n     year = {Year},\n     volume = {Volume},\n     pages = {Page Numbers},\n     publisher = {Publisher},\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Upload the `.bib` File to Overleaf\n1. **Log in to Overleaf**: Go to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) and log in to your account.\n\n2. **Open Your Project**: Navigate to the project where you want to add the bibliography.\n\n3. **Upload the File**:\n   - Click on the \"Menu\" button (usually represented by three horizontal lines) in the upper-left corner of the Overleaf editor.\n   - Select \"Upload\" from the dropdown menu.\n   - Drag and drop your `.bib` file into the upload area or click \"Select a file\" to browse your computer and select the file.\n\n### Step 3: Integrate the Bibliography in Your LaTeX Document\n1. **Include the Bibliography in Your Document**:\n   - At the end of your LaTeX document, add the following lines to include the bibliography:\n     ```latex\n     \\bibliographystyle{plain} % Choose a style, e.g., plain, unsrt, alpha, etc.\n     \\bibliography{filename}   % Replace 'filename' with the name of your .bib file without the extension\n     ```\n\n2. **Cite References in Your Document**:\n   - Use the `\\cite{key}` command to cite references within your text, where `key` corresponds to the citation key in your `.bib` file.\n\n### Step 4: Compile Your Document\n1. **Compile the Document**: Click on the \"Recompile\" button to compile your document. Overleaf will process the bibliography and integrate it into your document.\n\n2. **Check for Errors**: If there are any errors, ensure that your `.bib` file is correctly formatted and that all citation keys used in the document match those in the `.bib` file.\n\n### Additional Tips\n- **Bibliography Styles**: You can choose different bibliography styles depending on your requirements. Common styles include `plain`, `unsrt`, `alpha`, `abbrv`, and more. You can also use packages like `natbib` or `biblatex` for more advanced citation features.\n- **Multiple `.bib` Files**: If you have multiple `.bib` files, you can include them by listing them in the `\\bibliography{}` command separated by commas.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully upload and use a bibliography database in your Overleaf project.",
        "optimized_response": "Uploading a bibliography database to Overleaf is a straightforward process, but it requires careful attention to ensure that your references are correctly formatted and linked to your LaTeX document. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:\n\n### Step 1: Prepare Your Bibliography Database\n\n1. **Choose a Bibliography Format**: Ensure your bibliography database is in a compatible format, typically `.bib` for BibTeX. If you have your references in another format, you may need to convert them to `.bib`.\n\n2. **Organize Your References**: Open your `.bib` file in a text editor and ensure that all entries are correctly formatted. Each entry should have a unique citation key, and fields like `author`, `title`, `year`, etc., should be correctly filled.\n\n3. **Check for Errors**: Use a BibTeX validator or a LaTeX editor with syntax highlighting to check for common errors such as missing commas, braces, or incorrect field names.\n\n### Step 2: Log in to Overleaf\n\n1. **Access Overleaf**: Go to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) and log in to your account. If you don\u2019t have an account, you\u2019ll need to create one.\n\n2. **Open Your Project**: Navigate to the project where you want to upload your bibliography database. If you don\u2019t have a project yet, create a new one by clicking on \u201cNew Project\u201d and selecting a template or starting from scratch.\n\n### Step 3: Upload the Bibliography File\n\n1. **Upload the File**: In your Overleaf project, click on the \u201cUpload\u201d button, usually located in the top-left corner of the file tree panel.\n\n2. **Select Your `.bib` File**: In the upload dialog, click \u201cSelect a file from your computer\u201d and choose your `.bib` file. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the file into the upload area.\n\n3. **Confirm Upload**: Once uploaded, your `.bib` file should appear in the file tree on the left side of the Overleaf interface.\n\n### Step 4: Link the Bibliography to Your Document\n\n1. **Edit Your LaTeX Document**: Open your main `.tex` file in Overleaf.\n\n2. **Include the Bibliography**: At the location in your document where you want the bibliography to appear, add the following lines:\n   ```latex\n   \\bibliographystyle{plain} % or another style of your choice\n   \\bibliography{your-bib-file} % replace 'your-bib-file' with the name of your .bib file without the extension\n   ```\n\n3. **Cite References**: Use the `\\cite{}` command in your document to cite references from your bibliography. Ensure the citation keys match those in your `.bib` file.\n\n### Step 5: Compile and Check\n\n1. **Compile Your Document**: Click the \u201cRecompile\u201d button to compile your document. Overleaf will process your `.tex` file and the bibliography.\n\n2. **Check for Errors**: Review the log for any errors related to the bibliography. Common issues include missing citation keys or syntax errors in the `.bib` file.\n\n3. **Review the Output**: Check the compiled PDF to ensure that citations and the bibliography are formatted correctly.\n\n### Step 6: Maintain and Update\n\n1. **Update References**: If you need to add or update references, edit your `.bib` file directly in Overleaf or upload a new version.\n\n2. **Recompile After Changes**: Always recompile your document after making changes to the bibliography to ensure everything is up to date.\n\nBy following these steps, you can safely and effectively manage your bibliography in Overleaf, ensuring that your references are correctly integrated into your LaTeX documents."

As organizations continue to adapt to this new normal, understanding its impact on employee productivity has become crucial. This section delves into the dynamics of remote work, exploring how it influences productivity and what strategies can be employed to optimize performance in a virtual environment.\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\nRemote work offers a unique blend of flexibility and autonomy, allowing employees to tailor their work environments to suit personal preferences. This shift has led to varied impacts on productivity, largely dependent on individual circumstances and organizational support systems.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of remote work is the elimination of commuting, which not only saves time but also reduces stress, potentially leading to increased productivity. For instance, a case study by Stanford University found that remote workers experienced a 13% performance increase, attributed to fewer breaks and sick days, alongside a quieter work environment.\n\nHowever, remote work also presents challenges. The lack of face-to-face interaction can lead to feelings of isolation, which may negatively impact motivation and productivity. Additionally, the blurring of work-life boundaries can result in burnout if not managed properly. To mitigate these issues, companies like Buffer and GitLab have implemented structured communication protocols and regular virtual check-ins to maintain team cohesion and support employee well-being.\n\nMoreover, technology plays a pivotal role in facilitating remote work. Tools such as Slack, Zoom, and Asana have become indispensable for maintaining communication and collaboration. Organizations that invest in robust digital infrastructure and provide training for these tools often see better productivity outcomes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe impact of remote work on productivity is multifaceted, with both positive and negative aspects. While it offers flexibility and can enhance performance, it also requires careful management to address potential downsides like isolation and burnout. By fostering a supportive remote work culture, investing in technology, and maintaining clear communication, organizations can harness the benefits of remote work while minimizing its challenges. As remote work continues to evolve, staying adaptable and responsive to employee needs will be key to sustaining productivity in this new era."

The guide should cover the following steps:\n\n1. Identifying the conflict\n2. Understanding the conflict\n3. Resolving the conflict\n4. Testing the solution\n5. Committing and pushing the changes\n\nPlease ensure that the guide is easy to follow and understand, and that it provides clear and actionable steps for resolving conflicts in a GitHub environment. Thank you!",
        "original_response": "Resolving merge conflicts in GitHub can be a common task when collaborating on projects. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve these conflicts:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Conflict\n1. **Notification**: When you attempt to merge branches on GitHub and there are conflicts, GitHub will notify you of the conflict.\n2. **Conflict Details**: Navigate to the pull request or the branch where the conflict is reported. GitHub will show which files have conflicts.\n\n### Step 2: Fetch and Checkout the Branch Locally\n1. **Open Terminal**: Open your terminal or command prompt.\n2. **Fetch Latest Changes**: Run `git fetch` to ensure you have the latest changes from the remote repository.\n3. **Checkout the Branch**: Switch to the branch with conflicts using `git checkout <branch-name>`.\n\n### Step 3: Merge the Target Branch\n1. **Merge Command**: Run `git merge <target-branch>` to merge the branch you want to integrate into your current branch. This will show the conflicts in your local environment.\n\n### Step 4: Resolve Conflicts\n1. **Open Conflicted Files**: Open the files with conflicts in your code editor. Conflicts are marked with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`.\n2. **Edit the Files**: Decide which changes to keep. You can choose one side, combine changes, or rewrite the section entirely.\n3. **Remove Conflict Markers**: After resolving, ensure all conflict markers are removed from the files.\n\n### Step 5: Test Your Changes\n1. **Run Tests**: If your project has tests, run them to ensure that your changes do not break anything.\n2. **Manual Testing**: Perform any necessary manual testing to verify the functionality.\n\n### Step 6: Stage and Commit Resolved Changes\n1. **Stage Changes**: Use `git add <file-name>` to stage the resolved files.\n2. **Commit Changes**: Commit the changes with a descriptive message using `git commit -m \"Resolved merge conflicts in <file-name>\"`.\n\n### Step 7: Push Changes to Remote\n1. **Push Command**: Push your changes to the remote repository using `git push origin <branch-name>`.\n\n### Step 8: Finalize the Merge on GitHub\n1. **Pull Request**: If you are working on a pull request, navigate back to GitHub.\n2. **Merge**: Once the conflicts are resolved and pushed, you should be able to merge the pull request without issues.\n\n### Additional Tips\n- **Backup**: Before resolving conflicts, consider creating a backup branch in case you need to revert changes.\n- **Communication**: If working in a team, communicate with your team members about the conflicts and how you plan to resolve them.\n- **Tools**: Consider using graphical tools like GitHub Desktop, SourceTree, or IDE-integrated tools for a more visual approach to resolving conflicts.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve merge conflicts effectively and maintain a smooth workflow in your GitHub projects.",
        "optimized_response": "Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide to resolving GitHub merge conflicts:\n\n### Step 1: Identifying the Conflict\n\n1. **Pull the Latest Changes**: Before starting, ensure your local repository is up-to-date by running:\n   ```bash\n   git pull origin main\n   ```\n   Replace `main` with the appropriate branch name if necessary.\n\n2. **Attempt to Merge**: Try merging the branch you want to integrate:\n   ```bash\n   git merge feature-branch\n   ```\n   If there are conflicts, Git will notify you with a message indicating which files have conflicts.\n\n3. **Check for Conflicts**: Use the following command to see which files are in conflict:\n   ```bash\n   git status\n   ```\n   Conflicted files will be marked as \"both modified.\"\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the Conflict\n\n1. **Open the Conflicted Files**: Open each conflicted file in your code editor. Conflicts are marked with:\n   ```\n   <<<<<<< HEAD\n   Your changes\n   =======\n   Incoming changes\n   >>>>>>> feature-branch\n   ```\n\n2. **Analyze the Changes**: Understand the differences between your changes (`HEAD`) and the incoming changes from the other branch.\n\n### Step 3: Resolving the Conflict\n\n1. **Decide on the Changes**: Choose which changes to keep. You can:\n   - Keep your changes\n   - Keep the incoming changes\n   - Combine both changes\n\n2. **Edit the File**: Manually edit the file to resolve the conflict. Remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) after making your decision.\n\n3. **Mark as Resolved**: Once resolved, mark the file as resolved by adding it to the staging area:\n   ```bash\n   git add path/to/conflicted-file\n   ```\n\n### Step 4: Testing the Solution\n\n1. **Run Tests**: If your project has tests, run them to ensure that the changes do not break existing functionality:\n   ```bash\n   npm test\n   ```\n   Replace with the appropriate command for your project.\n\n2. **Manual Testing**: Perform any necessary manual testing to verify that the application behaves as expected.\n\n### Step 5: Committing and Pushing the Changes\n\n1. **Commit the Resolved Changes**: Once you are satisfied with the resolution, commit the changes:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -m \"Resolved merge conflict in [file-name]\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Push the Changes**: Push the resolved changes to the remote repository:\n   ```bash\n   git push origin main\n   ```\n   Again, replace `main` with the appropriate branch name.\n\n3. **Verify on GitHub**: Check your GitHub repository to ensure the merge was successful and that there are no remaining conflicts.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively resolve merge conflicts in a GitHub environment. Remember to communicate with your team if you're unsure about which changes to keep, as collaboration can often lead to the best solution."

This workflow is triggered by a push event to the `main` branch, can be manually triggered, and runs on a schedule.\n\n### Example Workflow: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`\n\n```yaml\nname: CI/CD Pipeline\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n  workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering of the workflow\n  schedule:\n    - cron: '0 0 * * 1' # Runs every Monday at midnight\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout code\n      uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n    - name: Set up Node.js\n      uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n      with:\n        node-version: '16'\n\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      run: npm install\n\n    - name: Run tests\n      run: npm test\n\n    - name: Build project\n      run: npm run build\n\n  deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    needs: build\n    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' # Only deploy from the main branch\n\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout code\n      uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n    - name: Deploy to server\n      env:\n        DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}\n      run: |\n        echo \"Deploying to server...\"\n        # Example deployment command\n        ssh -i $DEPLOY_KEY user@server \"cd /path/to/app && git pull && npm install && npm run start\"\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Workflow\n\n1. **Workflow Name**: The workflow is named \"CI/CD Pipeline\" for easy identification in the GitHub Actions interface.\n\n2. **Triggers**:\n   - **Push**: The workflow is triggered on a push to the `main` branch.\n   - **Manual Trigger**: The `workflow_dispatch` event allows users to manually trigger the workflow from the GitHub Actions tab.\n   - **Scheduled Trigger**: The `cron` syntax schedules the workflow to run every Monday at midnight.\n\n3. **Jobs**:\n   - **Build Job**:\n     - **Runs-on**: The job runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.\n     - **Steps**:\n       - **Checkout Code**: Uses the `actions/checkout` action to clone the repository.\n       - **Set up Node.js**: Uses `actions/setup-node` to set up Node.js version 16.\n       - **Install Dependencies**: Runs `npm install` to install project dependencies.\n       - **Run Tests**: Executes `npm test` to run the test suite.\n       - **Build Project**: Runs `npm run build` to build the project.\n\n   - **Deploy Job**:\n     - **Runs-on**: Also runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.\n     - **Needs**: This job depends on the successful completion of the `build` job.\n     - **Conditional Execution**: The job only runs if the branch is `main`.\n     - **Steps**:\n       - **Checkout Code**: Again uses `actions/checkout` to ensure the latest code is available.\n       - **Deploy to Server**: Uses an SSH command to deploy the application to a server. The `DEPLOY_KEY` is a secret stored in the repository settings, ensuring secure access to the server.\n\n### Features and Configuration Options\n\n- **Branch Filtering**: The workflow is configured to trigger only on changes to the `main` branch, preventing unnecessary builds on other branches.\n- **Manual and Scheduled Triggers**: Provides flexibility to run the workflow on-demand or on a regular schedule.\n- **Job Dependencies**: The `deploy` job depends on the `build` job, ensuring that deployment only occurs if the build is successful.\n- **Secrets Management**: Uses GitHub Secrets to securely manage sensitive information like SSH keys.\n- **Conditional Execution**: The `if` condition ensures that deployment only occurs from the `main` branch, adding an extra layer of control.\n\nThis example demonstrates a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, which can be expanded with additional jobs, steps, and conditions to suit more complex workflows."

        "original_response": "Certainly! To provide a meaningful analysis of the cinematography in a specific movie, it would be helpful to know which film you're referring to. However, I can offer a general framework for analyzing cinematography that you can apply to any film.\n\n### Composition and Framing\nThe composition and framing in a film are crucial in guiding the audience's focus and conveying the story's themes. Look for how the director and cinematographer use the rule of thirds, leading lines, and symmetry to create visually compelling scenes. Consider how close-ups, wide shots, and the use of negative space contribute to the emotional tone and narrative.\n\n### Lighting\nLighting plays a significant role in setting the mood and atmosphere of a film. Analyze how natural light, shadows, and artificial lighting are used to enhance the story. High-key lighting might be used for a more upbeat or comedic scene, while low-key lighting can create tension and drama.\n\n### Color Palette\nThe color palette can significantly affect the film's emotional impact. Pay attention to the dominant colors and how they change throughout the movie. Warm colors might evoke feelings of comfort or passion, while cooler tones can suggest detachment or melancholy. The use of color grading in post-production can also be a powerful tool in establishing the film's aesthetic.\n\n### Camera Movement\nCamera movement can add dynamism to a scene or create a sense of intimacy or detachment. Consider how techniques like tracking shots, pans, tilts, and handheld camera work are employed. A steady cam might be used for a smooth, controlled feel, while a shaky cam can heighten tension and realism.\n\n### Depth of Field and Focus\nThe use of depth of field and focus can direct the viewer's attention and highlight important elements within a scene. Shallow depth of field can isolate a subject from the background, emphasizing their importance, while deep focus can keep multiple elements in view, adding complexity to the scene.\n\n### Symbolism and Visual Metaphors\nCinematography often uses visual symbolism to add layers of meaning to the narrative. Look for recurring visual motifs or metaphors that enhance the story's themes. This could be anything from the use of mirrors to explore identity to the framing of characters within doorways to suggest transition or entrapment.\n\nBy examining these elements, you can gain a deeper understanding of how cinematography contributes to the storytelling and emotional impact of a film. If you have a specific movie in mind, I can tailor the analysis to that film's unique cinematographic style.",
        "optimized_response": "To provide a thoughtful analysis of the visual storytelling in a movie, it's important to consider several key elements that contribute to how the story is conveyed through visuals. Since you haven't specified a particular movie, I'll outline a general approach that can be applied to any film.\n\n### Cinematography\n\n1. **Composition and Framing**: Analyze how the director and cinematographer use composition to guide the viewer's attention. Consider the use of the rule of thirds, leading lines, and symmetry. For instance, tight framing might create a sense of claustrophobia or intimacy, while wide shots can establish a sense of scale or isolation.\n\n2. **Camera Movement**: Examine how camera movements like pans, tilts, dollies, and handheld shots contribute to the narrative. Smooth, flowing movements might suggest calmness or elegance, while shaky, erratic movements can convey chaos or tension.\n\n3. **Lighting**: Consider how lighting is used to set the mood and tone. High-key lighting might be used for a cheerful, open atmosphere, while low-key lighting can create suspense or highlight emotional depth. Pay attention to the use of shadows and highlights to emphasize certain aspects of a scene or character.\n\n### Color Palette\n\n1. **Color Symbolism**: Analyze the color palette and its symbolic meanings. Warm colors might evoke feelings of comfort or passion, while cool colors can suggest detachment or melancholy. Consider how color is used to differentiate between settings, time periods, or emotional states.\n\n2. **Color Contrast**: Look at how contrasting colors are used to draw attention to specific elements or create visual tension. Complementary colors can make a scene more vibrant, while analogous colors might create harmony.\n\n### Production Design\n\n1. **Set Design and Props**: Evaluate how the physical environment supports the story. The choice of locations, set decorations, and props can provide insight into the characters' personalities, social status, or historical context.\n\n2. **Costume Design**: Consider how costumes reflect character development or thematic elements. Changes in a character's wardrobe might signify personal growth, a shift in status, or internal conflict.\n\n### Editing\n\n1. **Pacing and Rhythm**: Analyze how the editing pace affects the storytelling. Quick cuts can create excitement or urgency, while longer takes might allow for deeper emotional engagement or reflection.\n\n2. **Transitions**: Look at how transitions between scenes are handled. Match cuts, dissolves, or jump cuts can serve different narrative purposes, such as linking ideas, indicating a passage of time, or creating disorientation.\n\n### Symbolism and Metaphor\n\n1. **Visual Metaphors**: Identify recurring visual motifs or symbols that enhance the narrative. These might include specific objects, colors, or patterns that carry deeper meanings or foreshadow events.\n\n2. **Subtext**: Consider how visual elements convey subtext or underlying themes. A seemingly mundane scene might be loaded with symbolic meaning that enriches the story.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the visual storytelling of a movie is a complex interplay of various elements that work together to enhance the narrative. By carefully analyzing cinematography, color, production design, editing, and symbolism, one can gain a deeper understanding of how a film communicates its story and themes beyond dialogue and plot. Each visual choice is deliberate, contributing to the overall impact and emotional resonance of the film."

Flowers are in bloom, and parks and gardens are particularly beautiful.\n   - **Summer (June to August)**: While summer offers long days and vibrant city life, it can also mean higher temperatures and larger crowds, especially in popular tourist destinations.\n   - **Autumn (September to November)**: Fall is often a great time to visit as the weather cools down, and the changing foliage can add a picturesque backdrop to your trip. It's also a time when many cities host cultural festivals.\n   - **Winter (December to February)**: If you enjoy winter sports or holiday festivities, winter can be a magical time to visit. However, be prepared for colder temperatures and possible travel disruptions due to weather.\n\n2. **Events and Festivals**: Consider visiting during a time when the city hosts unique events or festivals that interest you. This can enhance your experience and provide a deeper cultural insight.\n\n3. **Tourist Crowds and Prices**: \n   - **Peak Season**: Typically coincides with the best weather and major holidays, leading to larger crowds and higher prices.\n   - **Shoulder Season**: The periods just before and after peak season often offer a good balance of favorable weather, fewer crowds, and more reasonable prices.\n   - **Off-Season**: While you might encounter less favorable weather, visiting during the off-season can mean fewer tourists and lower costs.\n\nOnce you provide the specific city, I can offer more detailed advice based on these factors."

The solution uses a sliding window approach with a hash map to keep track of the characters and their most recent indices.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1. **Initialize Variables:**\n   - `char_index_map`: A dictionary to store the last index of each character encountered.\n   - `longest`: An integer to keep track of the length of the longest substring found so far.\n   - `start`: An integer to represent the starting index of the current substring window.\n\n2. **Iterate Over the String:**\n   - Use a for loop with `enumerate` to get both the index (`end`) and the character (`char`) as you iterate over the string `s`.\n\n3. **Check for Repeating Characters:**\n   - If the character `char` is already in `char_index_map` and its stored index is greater than or equal to `start`, it means the character is repeating within the current window.\n   - Update `start` to `char_index_map[char] + 1` to move the start of the window past the last occurrence of the repeating character.\n\n4. **Update the Character Index Map:**\n   - Set `char_index_map[char]` to the current index `end`.\n\n5. **Calculate the Length of the Current Substring:**\n   - Calculate the length of the current substring as `end - start + 1`.\n   - Update `longest` with the maximum of its current value and the length of the current substring.\n\n6. **Return the Result:**\n   - After the loop, `longest` contains the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the solution in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the string, by ensuring each character is processed at most twice (once when added and once when the window is adjusted)."

        "original_response": "One effective mental exercise for managing anxiety is called \"The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique.\" This exercise helps individuals anchor themselves in the present moment, reducing the overwhelming feelings often associated with anxiety. Here's how it works:\n\n### The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique\n\n#### Step-by-Step Guide:\n\n1. **5 Things You Can See:**\n   - Look around you and identify five things you can see. It could be anything in your immediate environment, such as a clock on the wall, a plant, or a piece of furniture. Take a moment to really notice these objects, their colors, shapes, and textures.\n\n2. **4 Things You Can Touch:**\n   - Focus on four things you can physically touch. This could be the feeling of your clothes against your skin, the chair you are sitting on, or the ground beneath your feet. Pay attention to the sensations and textures.\n\n3. **3 Things You Can Hear:**\n   - Listen carefully and identify three sounds you can hear. It might be the hum of a computer, birds chirping outside, or distant traffic. Try to focus on the sounds without judging or analyzing them.\n\n4. **2 Things You Can Smell:**\n   - Identify two things you can smell. If you can\u2019t find two distinct smells, think of two of your favorite scents and imagine them. This could be the smell of fresh coffee, a favorite perfume, or the scent of rain.\n\n5. **1 Thing You Can Taste:**\n   - Focus on one thing you can taste. It could be the lingering taste of a meal, a sip of water, or simply the taste of your own mouth. If you can\u2019t taste anything at the moment, think of a taste you enjoy.\n\n#### How It Works:\n\n- **Mindfulness and Presence:** This exercise encourages mindfulness by directing attention away from anxious thoughts and towards the present moment. By engaging the senses, it helps break the cycle of rumination and worry.\n\n- **Sensory Engagement:** Engaging the senses can help calm the nervous system. It shifts focus from internal anxiety to external reality, which can be grounding and soothing.\n\n- **Cognitive Distraction:** By concentrating on specific tasks (identifying sensory inputs), the mind is distracted from anxiety-provoking thoughts, providing a mental break and reducing stress.\n\n- **Emotional Regulation:** This technique can help regulate emotions by creating a sense of control and stability, which is often lacking during anxious episodes.\n\nThis exercise can be practiced anywhere and anytime, making it a versatile tool for managing anxiety. Regular practice can enhance its effectiveness, helping individuals develop a habit of grounding themselves whenever they feel anxious.",
        "optimized_response": "Certainly! Here's a mental exercise called \"The Calm Anchor Technique\" designed to help individuals regulate their anxiety levels. This exercise combines elements of mindfulness, visualization, and deep breathing to create a calming effect on the mind and body.\n\n### The Calm Anchor Technique\n\n#### Objective:\nTo reduce anxiety by grounding the individual in the present moment and fostering a sense of calm and control.\n\n#### Duration:\n10-15 minutes\n\n#### Frequency:\nOnce or twice daily, or whenever anxiety levels begin to rise.\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n1. **Find a Comfortable Position:**\n   - Sit or lie down in a comfortable position. Ensure your environment is quiet and free from distractions. Close your eyes gently.\n\n2. **Deep Breathing:**\n   - Begin with deep breathing. Inhale slowly through your nose for a count of four, hold the breath for a count of four, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Repeat this cycle five times, focusing on the sensation of your breath entering and leaving your body.\n\n3. **Visualization of the Anchor:**\n   - Visualize an anchor in your mind. This anchor represents stability and grounding. Imagine it being lowered into the ocean, slowly descending until it reaches the seabed, securing itself firmly.\n\n4. **Connect with the Anchor:**\n   - As you visualize the anchor, imagine that it is connected to you. Feel its stability and strength. With each breath, imagine the anchor pulling you gently down, grounding you in the present moment.\n\n5. **Affirmation:**\n   - Silently repeat a calming affirmation, such as \"I am anchored and calm\" or \"I am safe and secure.\" Sync the repetition of this affirmation with your breathing rhythm.\n\n6. **Body Scan:**\n   - Conduct a slow body scan from head to toe. As you focus on each part of your body, imagine the anchor's stability spreading through you, releasing tension and anxiety. Acknowledge any areas of discomfort without judgment and visualize them relaxing.\n\n7. **Return to the Present:**\n   - Gradually bring your awareness back to the present moment. Wiggle your fingers and toes, and when you feel ready, open your eyes. Take a moment to notice how you feel compared to when you started.\n\n#### Benefits:\n\n- **Reduces Physiological Symptoms of Anxiety:** The deep breathing component helps activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which reduces heart rate and promotes relaxation.\n  \n- **Enhances Mindfulness:** By focusing on the visualization and the present moment, individuals can break the cycle of anxious thoughts and reduce rumination.\n\n- **Promotes Emotional Regulation:** The exercise encourages a sense of control and stability, which can help manage emotional responses to stressors.\n\n- **Improves Focus and Concentration:** Regular practice can enhance attention and concentration by training the mind to focus on a single point of reference (the anchor).\n\n- **Increases Self-Awareness:** The body scan component helps individuals become more aware of their physical and emotional states, fostering better self-understanding and self-care.\n\nBy incorporating the Calm Anchor Technique into daily routines, individuals can develop a reliable tool for managing anxiety, leading to improved mental wellbeing and resilience."

        "original_response": "In German, verbs are typically conjugated to match the subject of the sentence, and the ending of the verb changes accordingly. Here are some tips on how to end a German verb based on the subject pronoun:\n\n1. **Regular Verbs in the Present Tense:**\n   - **ich (I):** Add **-e** to the verb stem. For example, \"machen\" (to do/make) becomes \"mache.\"\n   - **du (you, singular informal):** Add **-st** to the verb stem. For example, \"machst.\"\n   - **er/sie/es (he/she/it):** Add **-t** to the verb stem. For example, \"macht.\"\n   - **wir (we):** Add **-en** to the verb stem. For example, \"machen.\"\n   - **ihr (you, plural informal):** Add **-t** to the verb stem. For example, \"macht.\"\n   - **sie/Sie (they/you, formal):** Add **-en** to the verb stem. For example, \"machen.\"\n\n2. **Irregular Verbs:**\n   - Some verbs are irregular and do not follow the standard pattern, especially in the second person singular (du) and third person singular (er/sie/es) forms. For example, \"sehen\" (to see) becomes \"siehst\" for \"du\" and \"sieht\" for \"er/sie/es.\"\n\n3. **Modal Verbs:**\n   - Modal verbs like \"k\u00f6nnen\" (can), \"m\u00fcssen\" (must), and \"wollen\" (want) also have unique conjugations. For example, \"k\u00f6nnen\" becomes \"kann\" for \"ich,\" \"kannst\" for \"du,\" and \"kann\" for \"er/sie/es.\"\n\n4. **Past Tense:**\n   - In the simple past (Pr\u00e4teritum), regular verbs typically add **-te** to the stem, with endings similar to the present tense. For example, \"machen\" becomes \"machte\" for \"ich,\" \"machtest\" for \"du,\" and \"machte\" for \"er/sie/es.\"\n\n5. **Subjunctive Mood:**\n   - The subjunctive mood (Konjunktiv) often involves adding **-e** to the stem for the first and third person singular, and **-en** for the plural forms. For example, \"machen\" becomes \"mache\" for \"ich\" in the subjunctive.\n\nUnderstanding these patterns will help you correctly conjugate and end German verbs in various contexts.",

The ending of a verb changes depending on the subject pronoun (ich, du, er/sie/es, wir, ihr, sie/Sie) and the tense being used. Here\u2019s a basic guide for regular verbs in the present tense:\n\n1. **Ich (I)** - Add **-e** to the verb stem.\n   - Example: machen (to do/make) \u2192 ich mache\n\n2. **Du (you, singular informal)** - Add **-st** to the verb stem.\n   - Example: machen \u2192 du machst\n\n3. **Er/sie/es (he/she/it)** - Add **-t** to the verb stem.\n   - Example: machen \u2192 er/sie/es macht\n\n4. **Wir (we)** - Add **-en** to the verb stem (same as the infinitive).\n   - Example: machen \u2192 wir machen\n\n5. **Ihr (you, plural informal)** - Add **-t** to the verb stem.\n   - Example: machen \u2192 ihr macht\n\n6. **Sie (they/you, formal)** - Add **-en** to the verb stem (same as the infinitive).\n   - Example: machen \u2192 sie/Sie machen\n\nRemember that irregular verbs may have different stem changes or endings, so it\u2019s important to learn those individually. Additionally, the verb endings will vary in other tenses, such as the past or future, so be sure to study those separately."

        "optimized_response": "A great cooking hack to enhance the flavor of a vegetarian dish without using meat is to incorporate umami-rich ingredients. One effective way to do this is by using a combination of mushrooms and soy sauce to create a depth of flavor that mimics the richness of meat. Here's a detailed explanation of how to achieve this:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- **Mushrooms**: Choose a variety like shiitake, cremini, or portobello, which are known for their umami content.\n- **Soy Sauce**: Opt for a low-sodium version to control the saltiness while still adding depth.\n- **Olive Oil**: For saut\u00e9ing.\n- **Garlic**: Adds aromatic depth.\n- **Onion**: Provides a sweet and savory base.\n- **Balsamic Vinegar**: Optional, for a touch of acidity and sweetness.\n- **Herbs**: Thyme or rosemary can complement the umami flavors.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Prepare the Mushrooms**: Clean the mushrooms with a damp cloth to remove any dirt. Avoid washing them under water as they can absorb moisture and become soggy. Slice them evenly to ensure they cook uniformly.\n\n2. **Saut\u00e9 the Aromatics**: In a large skillet, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add finely chopped onion and garlic, and saut\u00e9 until the onion becomes translucent and the garlic is fragrant.\n\n3. **Cook the Mushrooms**: Add the sliced mushrooms to the skillet. Cook them over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until they release their moisture and start to brown. This process can take about 8-10 minutes.\n\n4. **Add Soy Sauce**: Once the mushrooms are browned, add a splash of soy sauce (about 1-2 tablespoons, depending on the quantity of mushrooms). Stir well to coat the mushrooms. The soy sauce will enhance the umami flavor and add a savory depth to the dish.\n\n5. **Optional Balsamic Vinegar**: For an additional layer of flavor, add a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar. This will introduce a subtle sweetness and acidity that balances the savory notes.\n\n6. **Season and Finish**: Add salt and pepper to taste. If desired, sprinkle fresh or dried herbs like thyme or rosemary for an aromatic finish.\n\n7. **Incorporate into Your Dish**: Use these umami-rich mushrooms as a topping for pasta, a filling for tacos, or a component in a grain bowl. They can also be mixed into a vegetable stir-fry or served as a side dish.\n\nThis technique not only enhances the flavor of vegetarian dishes but also provides a satisfying, meaty texture without any animal products. The combination of mushrooms and soy sauce is a powerful way to add complexity and richness to your cooking."

This could be arithmetic (constant difference between terms), geometric (constant ratio between terms), or something more complex.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Sequence**: If the sequence is arithmetic with a common difference \\( d \\), the \\( n \\)-th term can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d\n   \\]\n   where \\( a_1 \\) is the first term.\n\n3. **Geometric Sequence**: If the sequence is geometric with a common ratio \\( r \\), the \\( n \\)-th term can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}\n   \\]\n   where \\( a_1 \\) is the first term.\n\n4. **Polynomial Sequence**: If the sequence follows a polynomial pattern, you might need to use methods like finite differences to determine the degree of the polynomial and then solve for the coefficients.\n\n5. **Recursive Sequence**: If the sequence is defined recursively, you might need to find a closed-form solution using techniques like characteristic equations (for linear recurrences) or generating functions.\n\n6. **Other Patterns**: For more complex sequences, you might need to use advanced techniques or recognize known sequences (like Fibonacci, Catalan numbers, etc.) and use their known formulas.\n\nWithout specific terms or a pattern, it's not possible to provide a precise formula. However, these steps can guide you in deriving a formula once you have more information about the sequence."

If the service was exceptional, you might consider tipping more than 20%.\n   - **Bars:** $1-2 per drink is common, or 15-20% of the total tab.\n   - **Delivery Services:** 10-15% of the total bill, or at least $2-5 per delivery.\n   - **Taxis/Ride-Sharing Services:** 10-15% of the fare, or at least $1-2 for shorter rides.\n   - **Hotel Staff:** $1-2 per bag for bellhops, $2-5 per night for housekeeping, and $1-2 for valet services.\n\n2. **Quality of Service:**\n   - **Excellent Service:** Consider tipping at the higher end of the range or even above it.\n   - **Good Service:** Stick to the middle of the standard range.\n   - **Average Service:** A tip at the lower end of the range is appropriate.\n   - **Poor Service:** While tipping is generally expected, you might tip less if the service was unsatisfactory. However, it can be helpful to provide feedback to the establishment so they can address any issues.\n\nUltimately, tipping is a personal decision and can vary based on your experience and financial situation.

Look for direct matches or synonyms that indicate the document addresses the same topic as the query.\n\n4. **Consider Context and Intent**: Beyond keyword matching, consider whether the document fulfills the intent behind the query. For example, if the query is seeking detailed information or instructions, a document that provides a comprehensive guide would be more relevant than one that only mentions the topic briefly.\n\n5. **Evaluate the Depth and Specificity**: Determine if the document provides enough depth or specificity on the topic to be considered relevant. A document that only touches on the topic superficially may not be as relevant as one that provides detailed insights or data.\n\n6. **Make the Classification**: Based on the analysis, classify the document as either relevant or not relevant.\n\n### Example:\n\n**Search Query**: \"Benefits of meditation for stress relief\"\n\n**Document Content Summary**: The document discusses various relaxation techniques, including yoga, deep breathing, and meditation. It provides a detailed section on meditation, explaining how it can reduce stress by promoting relaxation and mindfulness. The document also includes scientific studies supporting the effectiveness of meditation in stress reduction.\n\n**Classification**: Relevant\n\n**Explanation**: The document is classified as relevant because it directly addresses the search query by discussing the benefits of meditation for stress relief.

It does not modify the original iterable but instead returns a new list.\n\n### Syntax:\n```python\nsorted(iterable, key=None, reverse=False)\n```\n\n### Parameters:\n- **iterable**: The sequence (list, tuple, string, etc.) that you want to sort.\n- **key** (optional): A function that serves as a key for the sort comparison. This is typically a function that takes one argument and returns a value to be used for sorting purposes.\n- **reverse** (optional): A boolean value. If set to `True`, the list elements are sorted as if each comparison were reversed (descending order).\n\n### Returns:\n- A new list containing all elements from the iterable in ascending order by default.\n\n### Examples:\n\n1. **Sorting a List of Numbers:**\n   ```python\n   numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]\n   sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n   print(sorted_numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]\n   ```\n\n2. **Sorting a List of Strings:**\n   ```python\n   words = [\"banana\", \"apple\", \"cherry\"]\n   sorted_words = sorted(words)\n   print(sorted_words)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n   ```\n\n3. **Sorting with a Key Function:**\n   ```python\n   words = [\"banana\", \"apple\", \"cherry\"]\n   sorted_words = sorted(words, key=len)\n   print(sorted_words)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n   ```\n\n4. **Sorting in Descending Order:**\n   ```python\n   numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]\n   sorted_numbers_desc = sorted(numbers, reverse=True)\n   print(sorted_numbers_desc)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 5, 2, 1]\n   ```\n\n5. **Sorting a List of Tuples:**\n   ```python\n   students = [(\"John\", 22), (\"Jane\", 21), (\"Dave\", 25)]\n   sorted_students = sorted(students, key=lambda student: student[1])\n   print(sorted_students)  # Output: [('Jane', 21), ('John', 22), ('Dave', 25)]\n   ```\n\n### Notes:\n- The `sorted()` function is versatile and can be used with any iterable.\n- The `key` parameter is particularly useful for complex sorting criteria.\n- Remember that `sorted()` returns a new list and does not change the original iterable. If you need to sort a list in place, consider using the `list.sort()` method."

        "optimized_response": "To provide a detailed analysis of a property description, I would need the specific text of the description you want analyzed. However, I can guide you on how to conduct such an analysis by highlighting what to look for in a property description. Here\u2019s a general framework you can use:\n\n### Positive Aspects\n\n1. **Location Highlights:**\n   - **Proximity to Amenities:** Look for mentions of nearby schools, parks, shopping centers, and public transportation. For example, \"just a 5-minute walk to the local elementary school\" is a strong selling point.\n   - **Neighborhood Appeal:** Descriptions of a safe, quiet, or vibrant neighborhood can be attractive. Phrases like \"nestled in a family-friendly community\" or \"located in a bustling downtown area\" can be positive.\n\n2. **Property Features:**\n   - **Modern Upgrades:** Highlight any recent renovations or modern features such as updated kitchens, new appliances, or energy-efficient systems. For instance, \"brand new stainless steel appliances\" or \"recently installed solar panels.\"\n   - **Unique Characteristics:** Architectural features like vaulted ceilings, hardwood floors, or a fireplace can add charm. Descriptions like \"original hardwood floors\" or \"cozy wood-burning fireplace\" are appealing.\n\n3. **Outdoor Space:**\n   - **Landscaping and Yard:** A well-maintained garden or spacious backyard is a plus. Look for terms like \"beautifully landscaped garden\" or \"expansive backyard perfect for entertaining.\"\n   - **Additional Structures:** Features like a garage, shed, or pool can be significant advantages. For example, \"detached two-car garage\" or \"private swimming pool.\"\n\n### Negative Aspects\n\n1. **Vague or Misleading Language:**\n   - **Lack of Specifics:** Phrases like \"needs TLC\" or \"potential for improvement\" can be red flags indicating the property requires significant work.\n   - **Overly Positive Spin:** Be wary of descriptions that seem too good to be true without evidence, such as \"luxury living at its finest\" without supporting details.\n\n2. **Condition Issues:**\n   - **Signs of Neglect:** Words like \"as-is\" or \"fixer-upper\" suggest the property may have maintenance issues.\n   - **Outdated Features:** Mention of older systems or styles, such as \"original 1970s kitchen,\" can indicate the need for updates.\n\n3. **Location Drawbacks:**\n   - **Undesirable Area:** If the description avoids mentioning the neighborhood or uses terms like \"up-and-coming,\" it might be in a less desirable location.\n   - **Noise or Traffic:** Phrases like \"close to major highways\" can imply noise issues.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Balance of Information:** A good property description should balance positive features with honest disclosures about potential drawbacks.\n- **Specificity and Clarity:** The more specific and clear the description, the better. This helps set realistic expectations for potential buyers.\n- **Visual and Emotional Appeal:** Effective descriptions often paint a picture of the lifestyle the property offers, appealing to the emotions of potential buyers.\n\nBy applying this framework to the specific property description you have, you can identify the strengths and weaknesses and make an informed assessment. If you provide the actual text, I can offer a more tailored analysis."

Here are some key factors to consider:\n\n1. **Tone and Sentiment**: Positive language and expressions of satisfaction often correlate with higher star ratings, while negative language and complaints suggest lower ratings.\n\n2. **Specific Compliments or Criticisms**: Look for specific mentions of what the reviewer liked or disliked, such as food quality, service, ambiance, or value for money.\n\n3. **Overall Experience**: If the review describes an exceptional or terrible experience, it might indicate a 5-star or 1-star rating, respectively.\n\n4. **Comparisons**: If the reviewer compares the restaurant favorably or unfavorably to others, it can provide context for their rating.\n\n5. **Length and Detail**: Detailed reviews might indicate a more thoughtful rating, while very short reviews might be more extreme (either very positive or very negative).\n\n6. **Use of Superlatives or Intensifiers**: Words like \"best,\" \"worst,\" \"amazing,\" or \"terrible\" can hint at the extremity of the rating.\n\nWithout the actual text of the review, it's impossible to accurately predict the star rating.

        "optimized_response": "To predict the rating an author might give to a restaurant based on their Yelp review, you would typically analyze the text of the review for sentiment and specific indicators of satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Here are some steps you might take to make this prediction:\n\n1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Use natural language processing (NLP) tools to determine the overall sentiment of the review. Positive sentiment generally correlates with higher ratings, while negative sentiment correlates with lower ratings.\n\n2. **Keyword Analysis**: Look for specific keywords or phrases that indicate strong feelings, such as \"excellent,\" \"amazing,\" \"terrible,\" or \"disappointing.\" These can provide clues about the likely rating.\n\n3. **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**: Identify specific aspects of the restaurant experience mentioned in the review, such as food quality, service, ambiance, and value. Determine the sentiment associated with each aspect to get a more nuanced understanding.\n\n4. **Length and Detail**: Longer, more detailed reviews might indicate a more thoughtful and potentially higher or lower rating, depending on the sentiment expressed.\n\n5. **Comparison with Other Reviews**: If possible, compare the review with other reviews by the same author to understand their rating tendencies.\n\n6. **Rating Distribution**: Consider the distribution of ratings for the restaurant. If most reviews are positive, a positive review is more likely to align with a higher rating.\n\nBy combining these methods, you can make an educated guess about the likely rating. However, without specific text to analyze, it's impossible to predict the exact rating."

Add the rinsed quinoa, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Remove from heat and set aside.\n\n2. **Prepare the Bell Peppers:**\n   - Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n   - Cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds and membranes. Lightly brush the outside of the peppers with olive oil and place them in a baking dish.\n\n3. **Cook the Filling:**\n   - In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.\n   - Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n   - Stir in the diced zucchini and cook for 3-4 minutes until slightly softened.\n   - Add the drained black beans, corn, and diced tomatoes to the skillet. Stir in the cumin, smoked paprika, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Cook for another 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.\n   - Add the cooked quinoa to the skillet and mix well. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.\n\n4. **Stuff the Peppers:**\n   - Spoon the quinoa and black bean mixture into each bell pepper, packing it tightly. If using cheese, sprinkle it on top of the stuffed peppers.\n\n5. **Bake:**\n   - Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the cheese (if using) is melted and bubbly.\n\n6. **Serve:**\n   - Remove the stuffed peppers from the oven and let them cool slightly. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve with lime wedges on the side for an extra burst of flavor.\n\n**Nutritional Benefits:**\n- **Quinoa** is a complete protein, providing all nine essential amino acids, and is high in fiber and various vitamins and minerals.\n- **Black beans** are rich in protein, fiber, and antioxidants.\n- **Bell peppers** are an excellent source of vitamins A and C.\n- **Zucchini** adds additional fiber and nutrients with minimal calories.\n\nThis recipe is not only nutritious and satisfying but also aligns with sustainable eating practices by focusing on plant-based ingredients that have a lower environmental footprint.
