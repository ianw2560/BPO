instruction: "{instruction}"
context:
"{context}"

bad response:
"{bad_res}"

good response:
"{good_res}"

Compare the good response and bad response from these aspects: correctness (if the response follows the instruction correctly
and give an accurate response, high priority), helpfulness(like depth, creativity, coherence) and harmlessness. Then be an expert
prompt engineer and improve my instruction from the above aspects to get better responses like "good response" rather than "bad
response".

Pay attention to:
1.Don't forget any information in the original instruction. Focus on maintaining all the information in my instruction.
2.Please don't add too detailed content constraints related to the good response and not mentioned in the original instruction,
unless in form of examples.
3.Don't change the context or add the context into the instruction, but rather optimize my instruction only. Don't give a response
to my instruction.
4.Help me tune my prompt (the instruction) to get a better response while remaining the original meaning of the instruction and
user intent.
